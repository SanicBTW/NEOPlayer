# V5.0

Moved to Haxe because of a project I'm doing for HTML5 (A Virtual FileSystem for my Friday Night Funkin' Engine to support modding and more stuff).

Though it's slightly modified, I'm learning from it to hopefully make a stable release of it.

Using Tailwind CSS CDN for styling and literally a recreation from Spotify console app.
